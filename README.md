Project Title : DIABETICS DETECTION
Language used : Machine Learning (python)
Aim of the project:  Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidentified. The aim of our project is to develope a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. Our project aims to predict diabetes via three different  supervised machine learning methods including: SVM, Logistic regression, ANN. The performances of all the three algorithms are evaluated on various measures like Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure, and Recall.  We have described a machine learning approach to predicting blood glucose levels and presented the results of recent experiments in hypoglycemia prediction .Training the model using six different classification algorithms, we obtain a precision equal to 0.757 and the recall of 0.762 after the best features selection step
